## Installation
Clone the source code into your computer.

## âœ¨Features
- Full error checking (password length checking, duplicated username, duplicated email, ...).
- Full responsive (in three sizes: desktop, tablet, and phone)
- User Authentication
- Context API: I've implemented the Context API, likely for managing user authentication and sharing data across components.
- Axios: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to your backend server. This is common for fetching data and interacting with APIs.
- File Uploading
- Loading Indicators: Loading indicators or spinners are displayed to inform users that content is being loaded.
- Form Handling: The "react-hook-form" library is used for handling form submission.
